# Plant Disease Prediction

This project uses deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict diseases in plants based on images.

## Features

- Predicts plant diseases from leaf images using CNN.
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Works with multiple plant types and diseases.

## Kaggle Dataset
